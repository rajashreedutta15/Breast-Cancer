# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Breast cancer data from a small hospital was provided and the analysis was intended to predict whether the patient had breast cancer or not. We used several models where the GaussianNB model had the best accuracy and other factors as well. However, with more data and a thorough study of the data, we can increase the accuracy and use the model in hospitals to detect breast cancer.
